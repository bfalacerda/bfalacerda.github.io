\begin{rSection}{About me}

I am a Senior Researcher in Robotics at the  Goal-Oriented Long-Lived Systems (GOALS) Lab, Oxford Robotics Institute, University of Oxford.
%
My research focuses on the intersection of decision making under uncertainty, formal methods and mobile robotics.
%
In particular, I am interested on the use of a combination of techniques from learning, planning and model checking to synthesise intelligent, robust and verifiable behaviour, both  for single and for multi-robot systems.
